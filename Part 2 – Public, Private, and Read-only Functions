Part 2 – Public, Private, and Read-only Functions

Clarity provides three types of functions, each with a specific execution context:

Public functions

Callable by users and other contracts

Can modify blockchain state

Must return a (response ...)

Example:

(define-public (increment (x uint))
  (ok (+ x u1)))

Private functions

Callable only within the same contract

Used for internal logic

Can modify state

(define-private (double (x uint))
  (* x u2))

Read-only functions

Cannot modify state

Free to call (no fees)

Ideal for views and queries

(define-read-only (get-balance (user principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? balances user)))
