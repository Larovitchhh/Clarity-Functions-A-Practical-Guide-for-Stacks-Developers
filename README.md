Clarity Functions: A Practical Guide for Stacks Developers
Part 1 – Why Clarity Functions Matter

Clarity is the smart contract language of the Stacks blockchain. Unlike most smart contract languages, Clarity is interpreted, decidable, and non-Turing complete, which means every function call is predictable before execution.
