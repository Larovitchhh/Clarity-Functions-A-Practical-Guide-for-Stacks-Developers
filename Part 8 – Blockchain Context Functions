Part 8 – Blockchain Context Functions

Clarity exposes blockchain state safely:

tx-sender

block-height

contract-caller

stx-get-balance

Example:

(define-read-only (who-called)
  tx-sender)


Because Clarity is interpreted, these values are known before execution, improving security and predictability.
